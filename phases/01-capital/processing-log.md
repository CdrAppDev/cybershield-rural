| 1 | RHT subaward criteria for SC not published | Requirements and process | Cannot prepare targeted application; blocking for RHT path |
| 2 | SCRA scoring methodology not publicly available | Investment thesis / criteria | Cannot optimize beyond general criteria |
| 3 | ARPA-H solicitation status unknown post-August 2025 cuts | Requirements and process | Cannot assess federal R&D path viability |

## Decisions Made

| # | Decision | Rationale |
|---|----------|-----------|
| 1 | Led with RHT and SCRA as co-primary funders | RHT offers largest amount ($200M SC allocation) with explicit cybersecurity language; SCRA offers most actionable immediate path with cybersecurity investment precedent |
| 2 | Classified 12 funders as viable out of 35 analyzed | Applied strict viability criteria: must accept applications from for-profit companies at early stage with healthcare cybersecurity positioning |
| 3 | Used official CMS name "Rural Health Transformation (RHT)" | CMS.gov documentation uses "RHT"; input file's "RHTP" is informal/incorrect |
| 4 | Included HHS OCR as profile despite not being a funder | OCR enforcement ($9.9M in 2024, HIPAA NPRM) creates market demand — essential context for funder conversations |
| 5 | Marked ARPA-H as viable despite funding cut uncertainty | $100M+ deployed in healthcare cybersecurity; private companies eligible; uncertainty flagged but path not eliminated |
| 6 | Excluded competitor deals from funder profiles | Blackwell, Claroty, MedCrypt are market context, not CyberShield funding sources |
| 7 | Classified accelerators as viable | Lower capital but provide validation, network, and investor access |
| 8 | Ranked Town Hall Ventures and CommonSpirit as "strong" | Highest explicit alignment with underserved/rural despite limited portfolio data |
| 9 | Excluded pending legislation from viable funders | Not enacted; cannot be relied upon for planning |
| 10 | Profiled all 35 distinct funding sources | Skill requires "every distinct funding source gets its own entry" |
| 11 | **Connective claim (thesis Executive Summary):** RHT funding ($200M SC) + no VC-backed rural competitors suggests a positioning opportunity | Connects CMS RHT data (CMS, December 2025) with competitive gap finding (research file 04) to infer market timing. Hedged with "suggests." |
| 12 | **Connective claim (thesis Funding Landscape):** Change Healthcare breach + budget increases supports interpretation of compliance-driven demand | Connects breach event (AHA, 2024) with budget survey data (Guidehouse, 2024). Hedged with "supports the interpretation." |
| 13 | **Connective claim (thesis SCRA section):** Center for Cybersecurity + ThreatCaptain investment indicates institutional appetite | Connects two SCRA data points (December 2025 Center launch + February 2025 $250K investment). Hedged with "indicates." |
| 14 | **Connective claim (thesis Regulatory section):** HIPAA NPRM + regulatory freeze suggests uncertain implementation timeline | Connects proposed rule (Federal Register, January 2025) with executive order freeze (January 2025). Hedged with "suggests." |
| 15 | Included counter-evidence: ARPA-H funding cuts alongside UPGRADE program | Writing governance requires proportional treatment of counter-evidence |
| 16 | Included counter-evidence: 16% rural hospital leaders delayed cybersecurity spending | Weakens near-term demand narrative; required by governance rules |
| 17 | Included counter-evidence: HIPAA rule regulatory freeze and hospital opposition | Weakens regulatory driver narrative; required by governance rules |
| 18 | Used conservative market projection ($75B/2032) over higher ($127B/2034) | Different projection methodologies; avoiding invented specificity from combining sources |
| 19 | Applied research register throughout thesis.md | Phase 01 requires analytical, third-person voice per vf-write register rules |
| 20 | Verified all narrative against word-boundaries.md | Removed first-person language, emotional intensifiers, and marketing terms per prohibited lists |
