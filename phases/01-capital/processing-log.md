| # | Topic | Value A | Source A | Value B | Source B | Resolution |
|---|-------|---------|----------|---------|----------|------------|
| 1 | SC Launch Inc. fund size | $15 million | Research file 02 (SCRA FAQ) | Not stated | Research file 01 (mentions $200K-$550K range) | Led with $15M from file 02 as more specific; file 01's range is per-investment, not fund size |
| 2 | SC Launch investment range | $200K-$300K per round | Research file 02 | $200K-$550K | Research file 01 | Presented $200K-$550K (file 01) as full range; $200K-$300K (file 02) may reflect typical range. NeuroQuest $550K in file 01 confirms upper bound |
| 3 | Program name: "RHTP" vs "RHT" | "Rural Health Technology Program (RHTP)" | Input funder-criteria.md | "Rural Health Transformation (RHT) Program" | CMS.gov (files 02, 03, 04) | Used official CMS name "Rural Health Transformation (RHT) Program." Note: input file used informal abbreviation "RHTP" which is not the official name |
| 4 | SBIR Phase I amount | Up to $305,000 | Research file 01 | Up to $314,363 | Research file 03 | Both presented; file 03 cites SBIR.gov Policy Directive more precisely. Historical amounts vary by agency. Used $314,363 as the more specific figure |
| 5 | Healthcare breach cost | $7.4M average | Input funder-criteria.md | $1.98B+ (Change Healthcare specific) | Research file 04 | Both are valid but measure different things. $7.4M is average breach cost; $1.98B is the Change Healthcare mega-breach cost. Used Change Healthcare figure as more impactful and recent |
| 6 | Rural hospitals lacking security | "Only 20% use available resources" | Input funder-criteria.md | "73% lack adequate defenses" / "less than 25% enrolled in Microsoft/Google programs" | Research files 03/04 | All three compatible. Used 73% (sourced) and 25% enrollment (sourced) as more precisely cited. Input file's "20%" likely from earlier/different methodology |
| 7 | HIPAA Security Rule update status | NPRM published January 6, 2025 | Federal Register (file 04) | "Frozen under regulatory freeze" / "100+ hospital systems signed letter urging withdrawal" | Research file 04 | Both are accurate — rule was proposed but then frozen. Presented both facts: proposed Dec 2024/published Jan 2025, then frozen under regulatory freeze Jan 20, 2025 |

|---|-----|----------|--------|
| 1 | RHT subaward criteria for SC not published | Requirements and process | Cannot prepare targeted application; blocking for RHT path |
| 2 | SCRA scoring methodology not publicly available | Investment thesis / criteria | Cannot optimize application beyond general criteria |
| 3 | ARPA-H current solicitation status unknown after August 2025 cuts | Requirements and process | Cannot assess viability of federal R&D path |
| 4 | SBIR/STTR reauthorization timeline unknown | Requirements and process | Non-dilutive federal path blocked indefinitely |
| 5 | SCRA membership-to-investment timeline not documented | Requirements and process | Cannot plan SCRA engagement timeline |
| 6 | Town Hall Ventures portfolio details thin — no URL for direct research | Portfolio / past investments | Viability assessment based on thesis match, not track record |
| 7 | CommonSpirit Ventures deal sizes not disclosed | Funding amounts | Cannot determine if check sizes align with needs |
| 8 | Most VC decision-maker backgrounds limited to partner names | Investment thesis / criteria | Cannot tailor outreach beyond publicly stated thesis |
| 9 | CISA vendor procurement criteria not available | Requirements and process | Cannot assess indirect contracting path |
| 10 | Healthcare cybersecurity-specific SBIR success rates not disaggregated | Portfolio / past investments | Cannot benchmark sector-specific competitiveness |

## Decisions Made

| # | Decision | Rationale |
|---|----------|-----------|
| 1 | Led with RHT and SCRA as co-primary funders | RHT offers largest amount ($200M SC allocation) with explicit cybersecurity language; SCRA offers most actionable immediate path with cybersecurity investment precedent |
| 2 | Classified 12 funders as viable out of 35 analyzed | Applied strict viability criteria: must accept applications from for-profit companies at early stage with healthcare cybersecurity positioning |
| 3 | Used official name "Rural Health Transformation (RHT)" instead of "RHTP" from input file | CMS.gov official documentation uses "RHT"; input file's "RHTP" appears to be informal/incorrect abbreviation |
| 4 | Included HHS OCR as a profile despite not being a funder | OCR's enforcement activity ($9.9M in 2024, HIPAA Security Rule NPRM) creates market demand — essential context for funder conversations |
| 5 | Marked ARPA-H as viable despite funding cut uncertainty | Program has deployed $100M+ in healthcare cybersecurity; private companies eligible; uncertainty is flagged but doesn't eliminate the path |
| 6 | Excluded competitor deals (Blackwell, Claroty, MedCrypt) from funder profiles | These are market context, not funding sources for CyberShield; used as evidence in thesis narrative only |
| 7 | Classified accelerators (MassChallenge, MACH37, Health Wildcatters) as viable | Lower capital but provide validation, network, and investor access that accelerates subsequent VC fundraising |
| 8 | Ranked Town Hall Ventures and CommonSpirit Ventures as "strong" viability | Both have highest explicit alignment with underserved/rural populations despite limited portfolio data; thesis match outweighs data gap |
| 9 | Excluded pending legislation (S.2169, H.R.10455) from viable funders | Not enacted; cannot be relied upon for planning. Noted for monitoring |
| 10 | Profiled all 35 distinct funding sources despite varying data quality | Skill requires "every distinct funding source gets its own entry"; thin profiles marked with confidence: low |
