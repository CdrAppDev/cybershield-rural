# Capital Thesis: CyberShield Rural

**Project:** CyberShield Rural
**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** 2026-01-28
**Status:** Pending Review

## Executive Summary

CyberShield Rural has **12 viable funding paths** across federal grants, state investment programs, venture capital, and accelerators — anchored by two high-confidence opportunities: the **CMS Rural Health Transformation Program** ($200M to South Carolina, with explicit cybersecurity language) and **SCRA/SC Launch Inc.** (which invested $250K in a cybersecurity startup in February 2025 and launched a Center for Cybersecurity in December 2025). No VC-backed startup dedicated to rural hospital cybersecurity was identified in the research — confirming a market gap that funders across categories should find compelling. The critical constraint is timing: RHT subaward criteria have not been published, SBIR/STTR programs are expired, and SCRA membership requires a working product beyond proof-of-concept.

## Funding Landscape

The healthcare cybersecurity funding environment has undergone a structural shift driven by three converging forces: the **Change Healthcare breach** (192.7 million individuals affected, $1.98B+ in costs) driving board-level cybersecurity awareness, **federal investment at unprecedented scale** ($50B Rural Health Transformation Program, $100M+ ARPA-H), and **proposed regulatory mandates** (HIPAA Security Rule update with $9B estimated first-year compliance cost). (Source: CMS, December 2025; Federal Register, January 2025; AHA, 2024)

The market is projected to grow from $19.3B (2024) to $75-127B by 2032-2034 at 18.5% CAGR, outpacing broader cybersecurity growth. (Source: Crunchbase 2025 Cybersecurity Report; Mordor Intelligence, 2025) VC investment reached $18B in cybersecurity in 2025, up 52% from 2024, with healthcare cybersecurity commanding particular attention following the Change Healthcare breach.

A critical finding: **no VC-backed startup dedicated to rural hospital cybersecurity** was identified during the research period (2024-2025). Rural cybersecurity needs are currently addressed through corporate philanthropic programs (Microsoft: 550+ hospitals enrolled; Google: pilot programs) and federal grants — not dedicated venture-backed companies. (Source: Microsoft On the Issues, June 2024; Status: Unverified gap — requires confirmation through additional deal database research)

## Funder Deep Dives

The following deep dives cover all viable funders with strong or moderate alignment. Non-viable funders are documented in funder-profiles.yaml with rationale for exclusion.

### CMS Rural Health Transformation (RHT) Program

**Type:** Grant (cooperative agreement)
**Amount:** $200M to South Carolina; Tech Catalyst Fund capped at $20M/year
**Viability:** Strong

**What They Fund:** The RHT Program is a $50 billion, five-year initiative distributing $10 billion annually to all 50 states through CMS. Category F explicitly funds "technical assistance, software, and hardware for significant information technology advances designed to improve efficiency, **enhance cybersecurity capability development**, and improve patient health outcomes." South Carolina's Tech Catalyst Fund provides "seed funding for innovative, startup health companies." (Source: CMS RHT Program Overview, December 2025; URL: https://www.cms.gov/priorities/rural-health-transformation-rht-program/overview)

**Criteria:**
- One-time, high-impact investments with sustainability plan (Source: Director Eunice Medina public statement, 2025)
- Must serve rural facilities and populations — 50% of funds allocated based on rural metrics (Source: CMS.gov, December 2025)
- Cybersecurity capability development explicitly eligible under Category F (Source: CMS RHT Program Overview)
- States distribute through subaward process; private companies participate as subrecipients or partners (Source: CMS RHT Program NOFO)

**Our Alignment:**
- Strengths: Cybersecurity capability development is our core offering; South Carolina received $200M; Tech Catalyst Fund specifically targets startups; grant-based (no dilution)
- Gaps: **State subaward criteria not yet published** — SCDHHS has stated guidance coming via Medicaid Bulletins; requires rural hospital implementation partner; must demonstrate sustainability beyond 5-year period

**Timeline:** State awards announced December 29, 2025. Subaward application dates not yet published. Contact grants@scdhhs.gov for Tech Catalyst Fund interest. (Source: CMS, December 2025; Timeline confidence: low)

(Source: ARPA-H, May 2024; URL: https://arpa-h.gov/news-and-events/arpa-h-announces-program-automate-cybersecurity-health-care-facilities)

**Our Alignment:**
- Strengths: Direct healthcare cybersecurity focus; private companies eligible; large awards
- Gaps: **August 2025 reports of ARPA-H funding cuts** (Politico); R&D focus requires advanced technical capabilities; awards skew to universities

**Timeline:** Current solicitation status requires direct verification with ARPA-H. (Timeline confidence: low)

### Accelerators (MassChallenge, MACH37, Health Wildcatters)

**Type:** Accelerator programs
**Amount:** Varies ($0-$380K; equity 0-8%)
**Viability:** Strong (MassChallenge, MACH37), Moderate (Health Wildcatters)

## Alignment Strategy

CyberShield Rural must pursue a **dual-track strategy**: non-dilutive grant funding (RHT, SCRA grants) as primary path, with accelerators and VC engagement building toward equity investment when traction demonstrates market validation.

### Priority Alignment Actions

1. **Subscribe to SCDHHS Medicaid Bulletins and contact grants@scdhhs.gov** — Addresses RHT Program's unpublished subaward criteria (blocking gap)
2. **Build working product beyond proof-of-concept** — Addresses SCRA's MVP requirement (blocking gap); required for all VC engagement
3. **Secure rural hospital LOI or pilot partnership** — Addresses RHT rural implementation requirement; validates market for VCs; demonstrates traction for SCRA
4. **Apply for SCRA Membership** — Prerequisite to all SCRA grant and investment opportunities; begin relationship with Regional Investment Manager
5. **Develop sustainability narrative** — Required by RHT; expected by all funders; Phase 06 (Business Thesis) deliverable
6. **Establish advisory board** — SCRA stated criterion; strengthens all applications; include healthcare, cybersecurity, and rural health expertise
7. **Prepare IP strategy** — SCRA evaluates "durable intellectual property protection"; include patents, trade secrets, or proprietary methodology
8. **Apply to MassChallenge and/or MACH37** — Non-dilutive (MassChallenge) or low-dilution (MACH37 5%) validation + network building; can pursue before MVP
9. **Enroll in 3Phase for SBIR readiness** — Free support; activate when SBIR/STTR reauthorized
10. **Build VC pitch materials for Town Hall Ventures and CommonSpirit Ventures** — Highest strategic alignment; approach after traction (Phase 12)

### Phase Dependencies

| Gap | Resolution Phase | Funders Affected |
|-----|-----------------|------------------|
| No working product | Phase 11 (MVP Build) | SCRA, all VCs, most accelerators |
| No rural hospital partner | Phase 12 (Customer Traction) | RHT, Town Hall, CommonSpirit |
| No sustainability model | Phase 06 (Business Thesis) | RHT, SCRA |
| No IP strategy | Phase 05 (Solution Thesis) | SCRA, Ballistic, Ten Eleven |
| No advisory board | Phase 05-06 | SCRA, all VCs |
| RHT subaward criteria unknown | External dependency (SCDHHS) | RHT |
| SBIR/STTR expired | External dependency (Congress) | SBIR, 3Phase, SCRA Federal Matching |
