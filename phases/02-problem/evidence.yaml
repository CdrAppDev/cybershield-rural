problem_statement: "Rural hospitals face a severe and worsening cybersecurity vulnerability: 73% lack adequate defenses, 68% operate without a dedicated cybersecurity leader, and 41% have experienced malware or ransomware attacks since early 2024, while thin operating margins and staffing constraints leave these approximately 1,800 facilities unable to adopt solutions designed for larger health systems."

prevalence:
  summary: "Approximately 1,800 rural hospitals serve 46-60 million Americans, with the majority lacking basic cybersecurity infrastructure, staffing, and budget to defend against escalating threats."

current_solutions:
  - name: "Microsoft Cybersecurity Program for Rural Hospitals"
    type: "Philanthropic program (free assessments, training, discounts)"
    limitations: "Microsoft describes the program as 'not entirely sufficient' and a 'stop-gap measure.' Provides assessments and discounts but not implementation funding or staffing. Only 49% of assessed hospitals passed basic vulnerability scanning."
    source: "Microsoft Rural Hospital Cybersecurity Landscape Report, March 2025"
  - name: "Fortified Health Security (MSSP)"
    type: "Managed Security Service Provider"
    limitations: "Best in KLAS four consecutive years and explicitly serves rural hospitals, but does not publish pricing. Industry estimates for healthcare MSSPs range from $5,000-$20,000/month."

    source: "Clearwater website, January 2026"
  - name: "Enterprise vendors (CrowdStrike, Palo Alto Networks)"
    type: "Enterprise endpoint and network security"
    limitations: "No rural hospital programs identified. CrowdStrike requires 299-endpoint minimum for MDR. Estimated annual cost of $15,000-$30,000+ for a 50-bed hospital."
    source: "CrowdStrike, Palo Alto Networks product pages, January 2026"
  - name: "Fortinet"
    type: "Network security vendor"
    limitations: "Only major commercial vendor with documented rural deployment (Rural Wisconsin Healthcare Cooperative). Lower entry cost ($700-$1,000 hardware) but requires in-house expertise to manage."
    source: "Fortinet product pages, January 2026"
  - name: "CISA Cyber Hygiene Services"

gaps:
  - gap: "No VC-backed startup dedicated exclusively to rural hospital cybersecurity"
    evidence: "Research across 2024-2025 identified no venture-backed company focused solely on this segment."
    source: "Capital thesis research (04-recent-activity.md, January 2026)"
  - gap: "No solution designed from inception for 0-1 security staff, sub-100-bed facilities, and $30,000-$50,000 annual budgets"
    evidence: "Enterprise vendors require 299+ endpoints or assume multi-million-dollar budgets. Cynerio's small hospital program was eliminated when Axonius acquired the company in July 2025."
    source: "03-current-solutions.md research; Axonius acquisition press release, July 2025"
  - gap: "92% of existing cybersecurity tools remain severely underutilized at rural hospitals due to staffing constraints"
    evidence: "Rural hospitals typically have 2-5 total IT staff handling all technology functions. Tools designed for dedicated security teams cannot be operated effectively."
    source: "Black Book Research Rural IT Survey, January 2026"

capital_alignment:
  aligned: true
  explanation: "The problem thesis aligns with the capital thesis across multiple funder criteria. The CMS Rural Health Transformation Program ($200M to South Carolina) explicitly lists cybersecurity as an eligible use of funds (CMS, December 2025). SCRA invested $250,000 in a cybersecurity startup (ThreatCaptain) in February 2025 and launched a Center for Cybersecurity in December 2025, indicating state institutional appetite. No healthcare cybersecurity company exists in the SCRA portfolio. Town Hall Ventures and CommonSpirit Ventures focus on underserved populations and operate critical access facilities. The problem data provides the evidence base funders require to justify cybersecurity investment in the rural hospital segment."
