gaps:
  - gap: "No solution designed from inception for 0-1 security staff, sub-100-bed facilities, and $30,000-$50,000 annual budgets"
    evidence: "Enterprise vendors require dedicated security teams; MSSPs price at $60,000-$240,000/year; Microsoft program is explicitly a stopgap"
    source: "Black Book Research; Microsoft Rural Hospital Report 2025"
  - gap: "No VC-backed startup dedicated exclusively to rural hospital cybersecurity"
    evidence: "Market consolidation (Cynerio → Axonius, Armis → ServiceNow) is moving healthcare security market upmarket; Fortified and Clearwater are closest but are MSSPs not purpose-built platforms"
    source: "Capital thesis research; KLAS Research 2025"
  - gap: "88% of rural IT stakeholders report vendors market 'urban-first' solutions as 'rural-ready'"
    evidence: "82% forced to adapt workflows to technology; only 29% agree vendors solve rural-specific problems"
    source: "Black Book Research Rural IT Survey, January 2026"
  - gap: "No pricing model scaled to rural hospital economics (per-bed, CAH-specific tiers)"
    evidence: "HSCC report states 'Rural hospitals are not small urban systems. They require rural-fit products, rural-fit implementation models, and rural-fit support.'"
    source: "HSCC 'On the Edge' Report, May 2025"

capital_alignment:
  aligned: true
  explanation: "The problem directly aligns with Phase 01 capital thesis: CMS RHT Program ($200M to SC) explicitly funds cybersecurity capability development under Category F; SCRA invested $250K in cybersecurity startup ThreatCaptain; all 12 viable funders identified in Phase 01 serve markets where validated rural cybersecurity need strengthens the investment thesis. Regulatory tailwind ($9B HIPAA compliance cost, pending CMS conditions) creates urgency that funders — particularly Town Hall Ventures (underserved populations) and CommonSpirit Ventures (critical access facilities) — are positioned to act on."
