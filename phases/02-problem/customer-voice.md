# Customer Voice: Rural Hospital Cybersecurity

## How Customers Describe This Problem

### Theme 1: Budget Constraints Force Impossible Trade-offs

> "We could have a couple million dollars for cybersecurity, or we can get that CT machine that we need to bring in more revenue and keep the doors open. And so that's the constant battle that we face from our budget, when we have to go to the board."
> -- Jim Roeder, VP of IT, Lakewood Health System (25-bed CAH, Minnesota); Source: HealthTech Magazine, June 2025

> "Our rural hospitals are facing unprecedented budget constraints with up to 30% or more in the red."
> -- Kate Pierce, Former CIO/CISO, North Country Hospital (25-bed, Vermont); Source: Senate HSGAC Testimony, March 2023

> "We're the least funded section of the delivery system, and we are the most vulnerable when it comes to cybersecurity. Everybody needs a lot of money to be able to support the cybersecurity infrastructure, because we are really facing a national crisis, which is a war against our healthcare providers every day, with bad actors domestically, but mostly abroad. And we just don't have the resources."
> -- Jennifer Stoll, Chief External Affairs Officer, OCHIN; Source: Chief Healthcare Executive, June 2025

> "For a couple of reasons: It is expensive, and to find the IT professionals, they have the same kinds of problems with recruiting people to be in the more rural communities."
> -- Bob Olson, President and CEO, Montana Hospital Association; Source: NPR, August 2024

### Theme 2: Staffing Gaps and Multi-Role IT Personnel

> "The rural hospital leaders I work with know exactly what needs to be done, but they're running on shoestring budgets with two to five people doing the work of 20. Meanwhile, threat actors are growing more sophisticated, using AI to exploit gaps in staffing, training and aging systems. The current state of rural health is one of constant triage, and cybersecurity has become yet another critical area competing for already-stretched resources."
> -- Jackie Mattingly, Senior Director of Consulting Services, Clearwater; Source: TechTarget, 2025

> "At a critical access hospital, all of us probably do five different job roles in a given day. It's just the nature of the beast."
> -- Jim Roeder, VP of IT, Lakewood Health System; Source: TechTarget, 2025

> "At a lot of these facilities, the IT director is looking at logs one minute, and the next minute, he's changing light bulbs."
> -- John Riggi, National Adviser for Cybersecurity, American Hospital Association; Source: HealthTech Magazine, 2024-2025

> "Oftentimes what I'm seeing is the director is not just the director of IT, but they are also working the help desk, being the network administrator, out there fixing printers on the floor, working the EHR -- so they're wearing, you know, 15, 20 hats. They just don't have the bandwidth to keep up."
> -- Jackie Mattingly, Senior Director, Clearwater; Source: TechTarget, 2025

> "The difference between being a Johns Hopkins or a UNC versus being a small critical access hospital or even just a one- or two-provider practice is significant because you have the same requirements. You have to protect your network, you have to do all those things, but you have a fraction of the staff."
> -- Kate Pierce, Former CIO/CISO, North Country Hospital; Source: TechTarget, 2024

### Theme 3: Operational and Financial Impact of Attacks

> "You're dead in the water. We were down a minimum of 14 weeks. And then you're trying to recover. Nothing went out. No claims. Nothing got entered. So it took months and months and months."
> -- Linda Burt, VP of Quality and Community Services, St. Margaret's Health (44-bed, Illinois); Source: NBC News, June 2023

> "This cyberattack is leading me to bankruptcy, and I am just about out of cash."
> -- Anonymous rural physician; Source: AMA Survey, April 2024

> "This crippled our brand new practice. I am keeping the lights on using personal funds."
> -- Anonymous rural physician; Source: AMA Survey, April 2024

> "...may bankrupt our practice of 50 years in this rural community."
> -- Anonymous rural physician; Source: AMA Survey, April 2024

> "The cyberattacks on Change Healthcare this year have caused a severe interruption to Nevada's Critical Access Hospitals."
> -- Blayne Osborn, President, Nevada Rural Hospital Partners; Source: Senator Rosen press release, July 2024

### Theme 4: Patient Safety and Geographic Isolation

> "The impact on rural communities during a cyberattack is hard to overstate. While attacks in urban areas are impactful, populated areas provide other healthcare options for patients to choose. In most rural areas, the next closest healthcare facility may be 45 miles away or more, making the diversion of patients infeasible."
> -- Kate Pierce, Former CIO/CISO, North Country Hospital; Source: TechTarget, 2024

> "We have to be able to offer care. There's not another facility for 40 miles -- we can't just say, 'sorry, we can't take you. Our network is down.'"
> -- Kate Pierce, Former CIO/CISO, North Country Hospital; Source: HealthITSecurity, 2024

> "We got to try and hope they have room for these patients. And you know, we have two ambulances. How do you get them there? How do you transport them there in a timely manner?"
> -- Jim Roeder, VP of IT, Lakewood Health System; Source: TechTarget, 2025

> "If you have a gun to your head, because they've got all your data and they've frozen your system, you're down. And you are creating a real vulnerability in terms of patient care."
> -- Jennifer Stoll, Chief External Affairs Officer, OCHIN; Source: Chief Healthcare Executive, June 2025

### Theme 5: Evolved Threat Awareness

> "If you are operating in an electronic environment, as most healthcare providers are, it is not if you will suffer a cyberattack, it is when you will become a victim and so organizations should make sure they are educating, communicating, and preparing for disaster recovery. They [threat actors] are going to get in."
> -- Steve Barnett, CEO, McKenzie Health System (CAH, Michigan); Source: Rural Health Information Hub, 2022

> "We're getting past where rural hospitals used to feel like, 'Oh, nobody's going to target us because we're rural.' They're starting to realize now that it doesn't matter where you are in the world, or whether you're rural or you're a large facility."
> -- Kate Pierce, Former CIO/CISO, North Country Hospital; Source: TechTarget, 2024

> "People don't realize how much these smaller systems are attacked and get hit by ransomware or are extorted just as much as the larger systems."
> -- Jim Roeder, VP of IT, Lakewood Health System; Source: TechTarget, 2025

## Common Language and Terminology

- **"Shoestring budget"**: How rural hospital IT leaders describe cybersecurity funding constraints
- **"Wearing multiple hats" / "15-20 hats"**: The universal description of IT staffing at rural hospitals where personnel handle security, help desk, networking, EHR, and physical maintenance
- **"Keep the doors open" / "Keep the lights on"**: Survival language used to frame cybersecurity as competing with basic operational needs
- **"Constant triage"**: How leaders describe the ongoing process of deciding which critical needs receive limited resources
- **"Dead in the water"**: The state of a hospital during and immediately after a ransomware attack
- **"It's not if but when"**: The evolved threat awareness replacing earlier assumptions of safety through obscurity
- **"Same requirements, fraction of the staff"**: The compliance disparity between rural and urban hospitals
- **"Nature of the beast"**: Resignation language conveying acceptance of structural staffing constraints
- **"Fighting algorithms with paper and spreadsheets"**: Anonymous COO description of the technology gap during attack recovery

## Emotional Intensity

The research source material documents a consistent emotional pattern across 17 distinct voices spanning congressional testimony, news interviews, and industry publications from 2023 through 2026. The dominant register combines resignation with urgent advocacy. Leaders describe knowing what needs to be done but facing structural barriers to implementation. The language shifts toward greater intensity when describing attack aftermath -- "dead in the water," "leading me to bankruptcy," "keeping the lights on using personal funds" -- indicating that the gap between awareness and capability is the primary source of frustration. Dark humor appears in staffing descriptions ("changing light bulbs"), suggesting a shared coping mechanism within the rural health IT community.

## Workarounds Attempted

- **Microsoft Cybersecurity Program enrollment**: Jim Roeder at Lakewood Health elevated the hospital's Microsoft secure score from 19.5 to 47 within months, reducing implementation timelines from 6-8 months to 10-12 weeks. "It's a journey that we're on, but we're far better off than we were a year ago." -- Source: HealthTech Magazine, 2025
- **Cloud-first strategy**: Kate Pierce at North Country Hospital: "We've gone with a cloud first strategy, and I can tell you that my IT manager has said he will never go back, because now he sleeps at night. When you think about the resources that these large EHR vendors have versus a small critical access hospital, we really can't provide the same service to maintain and secure those servers." -- Source: TechTarget, 2024
- **External expertise partnerships**: Virgil Eyer at Fulton County Medical Center (21-bed CAH, Pennsylvania): "It's nice to have someone who has been there from the ground floor and can help out with any questions or concerns. Our goal is to be proactive instead of reactive." -- Source: HealthTech Magazine, September 2025
- **Paper-based fallback**: St. Margaret's Health used 60,000 sheets of paper during its ransomware attack to maintain operations manually. -- Source: NBC News, June 2023
- **Personal funds**: During the Change Healthcare breach, 55% of physician practices used personal funds to cover expenses. -- Source: AMA Survey, April 2024
- **Compliance-as-minimum**: Anonymous hospital IT professional: "Compliance is a low bar. I guarantee that little healthcare organizations and hospitals would do nothing [without regulation]. They would have a piece of paper on a shelf called their security policy." -- Source: PubMed Central academic study, 2024
