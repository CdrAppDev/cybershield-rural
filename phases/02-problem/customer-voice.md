# Customer Voice: Rural Hospital Cybersecurity

## How Customers Describe This Problem

### Theme 1: Impossible Budget Trade-offs

> "We could have a couple million dollars for cybersecurity, or we can get that CT machine that we need to bring in more revenue and keep the doors open. And so that's the constant battle that we face from our budget, when we have to go to the board."
> — Jim Roeder, VP of IT, Lakewood Health System (25-bed CAH, MN), HealthTech Magazine/TechTarget, 2025

> "Our rural hospitals are facing unprecedented budget constraints with up to 30% or more in the red."
> — Kate Pierce, Former CIO/CISO, North Country Hospital (25-bed CAH, VT), Senate HSGAC Testimony, March 2023

> "We're the least funded section of the delivery system, and we are the most vulnerable when it comes to cybersecurity. Everybody needs a lot of money to be able to support the cybersecurity infrastructure, because we are really facing a national crisis, which is a war against our healthcare providers every day, with bad actors domestically, but mostly abroad. And we just don't have the resources."
> — Jennifer Stoll, Chief External Affairs Officer, OCHIN, Chief Healthcare Executive, June 2025

### Theme 2: Staffing Crisis — Wearing 15-20 Hats

> "The rural hospital leaders I work with know exactly what needs to be done, but they're running on shoestring budgets with two to five people doing the work of 20. Meanwhile, threat actors are growing more sophisticated, using AI to exploit gaps in staffing, training and aging systems. The current state of rural health is one of constant triage, and cybersecurity has become yet another critical area competing for already-stretched resources."
> — Jackie Mattingly, Senior Director, Clearwater, TechTarget, 2025

> "At a critical access hospital, all of us probably do five different job roles in a given day. It's just the nature of the beast."
> — Jim Roeder, VP of IT, Lakewood Health System, 2025

> "At a lot of these facilities, the IT director is looking at logs one minute, and the next minute, he's changing light bulbs."
> — John Riggi, National Adviser for Cybersecurity, AHA, HealthTech Magazine, 2024-2025

> "Oftentimes what I'm seeing is the director is not just the director of IT, but they are also working the help desk, being the network administrator, out there fixing printers on the floor, working the EHR—so they're wearing, you know, 15, 20 hats. They just don't have the bandwidth to keep up."
> — Jackie Mattingly, Senior Director, Clearwater, 2025

> "The difference between being a Johns Hopkins or a UNC versus being a small critical access hospital or even just a one- or two-provider practice is significant because you have the same requirements. You have to protect your network, you have to do all those things, but you have a fraction of the staff."
> — Kate Pierce, Former CIO/CISO, North Country Hospital, 2024

### Theme 3: Existential Threat — One Attack From Closure

> "You're dead in the water. We were down a minimum of 14 weeks. And then you're trying to recover. Nothing went out. No claims. Nothing got entered. So it took months and months and months."
> — Linda Burt, VP of Quality, St. Margaret's Health (44-bed rural hospital, IL), NBC News, June 2023

> "Due to a number of factors, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, the cyberattack on the computer system of St. Margaret's Health, and a shortage of staff, it has become impossible to sustain our ministry."
> — Sister Suzanne Stahl, Chair, SMP Health, Facebook/Fierce Healthcare, 2023

> "This cyberattack is leading me to bankruptcy, and I am just about out of cash."
> — Anonymous rural physician, AMA Survey, April 2024

> "This crippled our brand new practice. I am keeping the lights on using personal funds."
> — Anonymous rural physician, AMA Survey, April 2024

> "…may bankrupt our practice of 50 years in this rural community."
> — Anonymous rural physician, AMA Survey, April 2024

> "These 'target rich, but cyber poor' medium, small and rural hospitals may be one bad day—one ransomware incident away—from a path to closure."
> — Joshua Corman, Claroty, cited by AHA, March 2025

### Theme 4: Patients Have Nowhere Else to Go

> "The impact on rural communities during a cyberattack is hard to overstate. While attacks in urban areas are impactful, populated areas provide other healthcare options for patients to choose. In most rural areas, the next closest healthcare facility may be 45 miles away or more, making the diversion of patients infeasible."
> — Kate Pierce, Former CIO/CISO, North Country Hospital, Congressional Testimony, 2023

> "We have to be able to offer care. There's not another facility for 40 miles—we can't just say, 'sorry, we can't take you. Our network is down.'"
> — Kate Pierce, North Country Hospital, 2024

> "We got to try and hope they have room for these patients. And you know, we have two ambulances. How do you get them there? How do you transport them there in a timely manner?"
> — Jim Roeder, VP of IT, Lakewood Health System, 2025

> "If you have a gun to your head, because they've got all your data and they've frozen your system, you're down. And you are creating a real vulnerability in terms of patient care."
> — Jennifer Stoll, Chief External Affairs Officer, OCHIN, June 2025

> "Those small facilities try to keep going, but the impact of continuing to see patients still can cause significant delays in care. We're so dependent on medical records now for the information that we use to treat our patients, so if a physician doesn't have access to the medical record when he's seeing the patient, he can't make the best possible decisions in that case."
> — Kate Pierce, North Country Hospital, 2024

### Theme 5: Awareness Without Capability

> "If you are operating in an electronic environment, as most healthcare providers are, it is not if you will suffer a cyberattack, it is when you will become a victim and so organizations should make sure they are educating, communicating, and preparing for disaster recovery. They [threat actors] are going to get in."
> — Steve Barnett, CEO, McKenzie Health System (CAH, MI), Rural Health Information Hub, 2022

> "We're getting past where rural hospitals used to feel like, 'Oh, nobody's going to target us because we're rural.' They're starting to realize now that it doesn't matter where you are in the world, or whether you're rural or you're a large facility."
> — Kate Pierce, North Country Hospital, 2024

> "People don't realize how much these smaller systems are attacked and get hit by ransomware or are extorted just as much as the larger systems."
> — Jim Roeder, VP of IT, Lakewood Health System, 2025

> "Just because they're low resource communities doesn't mean that it's not great data to be able to hijack or steal."
> — Jennifer Stoll, Chief External Affairs Officer, OCHIN, June 2025

> "Compliance is a low bar. I guarantee that little healthcare organizations and hospitals would do nothing [without regulation]. They would have a piece of paper on a shelf called their security policy. It's needed as a backstop to get companies at least thinking about it. But being compliant does not solve the greater risk management problem."
> — Anonymous hospital IT professional, PubMed Central, academic study

## Common Language and Terminology

- **"Wearing multiple hats" / "15-20 hats"**: Universal description of IT staff doing security plus helpdesk, network admin, EHR support, and facilities
- **"Shoestring budget"**: How they describe cybersecurity funding allocation
- **"Keep the doors open" / "Keep the lights on"**: Existential framing — cybersecurity competes with hospital survival
- **"Dead in the water"**: Post-attack operational state
- **"It's not if but when"**: Evolved threat awareness replacing the old "we're too small to target" mindset
- **"Constant triage"**: How they describe daily prioritization under resource constraint
- **"Nature of the beast"**: Resignation about multi-role reality
- **"Gun to your head"**: Ransomware pressure during active incident
- **"Same requirements, fraction of the staff"**: Core disparity complaint — HIPAA doesn't scale down
- **"Fighting algorithms with paper and spreadsheets"**: Technology disparity
- **"One bad day away from closure"**: Existential vulnerability

## Emotional Intensity

The emotional register across 17 distinct voices follows a consistent pattern: **resignation mixed with urgent advocacy**. These are not people who have given up — they document their constraints with precision and advocate for change — but they've accepted that individual action within their hospitals cannot solve a systemic problem.

The most intense emotional moments come from the Change Healthcare breach responses (fear, desperation — "leading me to bankruptcy," "keeping the lights on using personal funds") and the St. Margaret's closure (grief, defeat — "dead in the water," "impossible to sustain our ministry").

Day-to-day voices use dark humor ("changing light bulbs," "nature of the beast") that masks exhaustion. The recurring pattern of listing exactly what they need — managed services, federal funding, vendor accountability — alongside acknowledgment that they cannot access these things reveals a population that is aware, articulate, and stuck.

## Workarounds Attempted

- **Paper-based fallback**: "We used 60,000 sheets of paper" during the St. Margaret's attack; paper processes are the universal fallback — Linda Burt, NBC News, June 2023
- **Cloud-first migration**: "My IT manager has said he will never go back, because now he sleeps at night" — Kate Pierce, North Country Hospital, 2024
- **Microsoft philanthropic program**: "We're far better off than we were a year ago" — secure score from 19.5 to 47 in months — Jim Roeder, Lakewood Health, 2025
- **Providing care without authorization**: "A lot of hospitals went ahead and provided services without prior authorizations. That is very, very nerve wracking" — Cassie Sauer, Washington State Hospital Association, April 2024
- **Personal funds**: "55% used personal funds to cover practice expenses" during Change Healthcare breach — AMA Survey, April 2024
- **Multi-role IT staff**: "The director is not just the director of IT, but they are also working the help desk, being the network administrator, out there fixing printers on the floor" — Jackie Mattingly, Clearwater, 2025
- **External partnerships**: "It's nice to have someone who has been there from the ground floor and can help out with any questions or concerns" — Virgil Eyer, Fulton County Medical Center (21-bed CAH, PA), HealthTech Magazine, September 2025
