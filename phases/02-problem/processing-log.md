## Evidence Excluded

| # | Evidence | Source | Reason for Exclusion |
|---|----------|--------|---------------------|
| 1 | "35-40% of breached small practices close within two years" | Critical Insight (unverified) | Flagged in research as unverified; requires primary source confirmation |
| 2 | "53% reported increased mortality" (Cynerio/Ponemon 2022) | Ponemon/Cynerio, 2022 | Superseded by more recent 2024-2025 Ponemon/Proofpoint data (28-29%); higher figure likely reflects different methodology |
| 3 | 83% of healthcare IoT devices run outdated OS | Claroty/Check Point Research, 2025 | Overlaps with 73% legacy OS statistic from HIMSS; used HIMSS as more widely cited baseline |
| 4 | 75% of infusion pumps have security vulnerabilities | Claroty/Check Point Research, 2025 | Medical device detail beyond problem thesis scope; more relevant for solution thesis (Phase 05) |
| 5 | $7.42M average breach cost (2025, down from $9.77M) | IBM/Ponemon, 2025 | Noted in limitations section; used 2024 peak figure as the more conservative framing since decline may reflect methodology changes |
| 6 | Median ransom payment dropped to $150K (2025) | Sophos, Oct 2025 | Noted in limitations section; sharp decline may reflect shifting tactics rather than reduced threat |
| 7 | Cyber insurance claims frequency surged ~90% in 2025 | Industry reports | Sourced from 01-prevalence.md conclusion with "unverified" flag; lacks specific primary source citation |
| 8 | 157 million Americans lack broadband access | Microsoft TechSpark | Relevant context but not specific to hospitals; connectivity barrier mentioned generally in solutions section |
| 9 | 16 state enforcement actions in 2023 | HITECH data | Regulatory detail not central to problem thesis; more relevant for regulatory compliance analysis |
| 10 | NY hospital cybersecurity rules (10 NYCRR 405.46) | NY DOH, Oct 2025 | State-specific regulation outside SC focus; used as context for regulatory trajectory |
| 11 | $144.9M total HIPAA settlements | HHS OCR | Aggregate enforcement figure; cited specific 2024 actions in regulatory context instead |

**Total quotes found:** 26
**Total quotes included:** 21 (20 in customer-voice.md body + 1 additional in thesis.md)
**Total themes identified:** 5
**Theme grouping rationale:** Themes were organized around the five dominant patterns that emerged independently across sources: (1) budget trade-offs between cybersecurity and operational needs, (2) staffing gaps forcing multi-role IT personnel, (3) operational and financial devastation from actual attacks, (4) patient safety risks amplified by geographic isolation, and (5) the shift from perceived immunity to awareness of vulnerability. These five themes capture the full arc of the rural hospital cybersecurity experience from structural constraints through lived consequences.

| 1 | Average breach cost | $9.77M (2024) | IBM/Ponemon, Aug 2024 | $7.42M (2025) | IBM/Ponemon, 2025 | Both presented; led with 2024 figure as most recent complete year; noted 2025 decline in limitations |
| 2 | Rural hospital recovery cost | ~$11M | AHA/Microsoft, March 2025 | $3.31M (orgs <500 employees) | IBM/Ponemon, Aug 2024 | Led with $11M as rural-specific figure from AHA national advisor; IBM figure is cross-industry for small orgs |
| 3 | Mortality correlation | 28-29% report increased mortality | Ponemon/Proofpoint, 2024-2025 | 53% increased mortality | Cynerio/Ponemon, 2022 | Used more recent 2024-2025 figure; noted methodological difference; excluded 2022 figure |

## Gaps Identified

| # | Gap | Category | Impact |
|---|-----|----------|--------|
| 1 | No per-CAH compliance cost for proposed HIPAA rule | Cost of status quo | HHS provides $9B aggregate but no per-facility breakdown for rural hospitals; limits precision of compliance cost section |
| 2 | MSSP pricing not publicly available | Current solutions | Cannot quantify actual cost barrier for Fortified and Clearwater; used industry-level estimate |
| 3 | Rural hospital cyber insurance adoption rate unknown | Cost of status quo | Cannot assess insurance as risk mitigation factor for rural specifically |
| 4 | SC-specific cyberattack data not available | Prevalence | No South Carolina rural hospital breach data found; relied on national figures |

**Total gaps identified:** 4

## Decisions Made

| # | Decision | Rationale |
|---|----------|-----------|
| 1 | Led with Black Book Research June 2025 data as primary prevalence source | Most recent survey specific to small/rural hospitals (187 leaders, facilities <150 beds); most comprehensive single source for staffing, defense, and compliance gaps |
| 2 | Used $11M rural recovery cost (AHA/Microsoft) over $3.31M (IBM small org) | AHA figure is rural-hospital-specific from national cybersecurity advisor; IBM figure is cross-industry for small organizations. Both cited but $11M used as lead severity figure |
| 3 | Used 2024 IBM breach cost ($9.77M) over 2025 ($7.42M) as primary | 2024 is most recent complete-year data; 2025 decline may reflect methodology changes. Both noted, decline addressed in limitations |
| 4 | Grouped customer voice into 5 themes | Five patterns emerged independently across 17 voices: budget, staffing, attack impact, patient safety, threat awareness. Considered merging patient safety with attack impact but kept separate because geographic isolation is a structural condition, not an incident outcome |
| 5 | Included mortality data with explicit hedging on causation | Peer-reviewed Medicare claims study (UMN/DePaul) establishes causal link; Ponemon survey data is correlational. Both included with appropriate qualifiers |
| 6 | Excluded 35-40% closure rate for breached small practices | Research file flagged this as unverified. No primary source identified. Cannot include uncited claims per skill rules |
| 7 | Included Sophos 2025 cost improvements as counter-evidence in limitations | Writing governance requires proportional treatment of counter-evidence. Sharp declines in ransomware payments and recovery costs could weaken cost projections |
| 8 | Positioned Change Healthcare as systemic risk case study, not rural-specific closure evidence | No rural hospital closures directly attributed to Change Healthcare breach. Research notes language indicates risk rather than confirmed outcomes. Used qualified language |
| 9 | Connective claim: Capital alignment section links problem severity data with funder eligibility criteria | Connected 73%/68% defense/staffing gaps (Black Book) with RHT Program cybersecurity eligibility (CMS) and SCRA cybersecurity investment (ThreatCaptain). Inference: problem data "provides the evidence base" for funder applications. Hedged with "supports" and "suggests alignment" |
| 10 | Connective claim: Market consolidation moving upmarket inference | Connected Cynerio/Axonius acquisition (July 2025) and Armis/ServiceNow acquisition ($7.75B) to infer market is "consolidating toward enterprise-scale offerings." Two independent M&A data points support this pattern; hedged with "indicate" |
| 11 | Connective claim: Financial fragility amplifies cyber risk | Connected 46% negative margins (Chartis) with $11M recovery cost (AHA/Microsoft) to suggest "a single ransomware incident could threaten the financial viability of most affected facilities." Hedged with "suggests" |
| 12 | Connective claim: Staffing shortage and tool underutilization | Connected 74% hiring difficulty and 70% longer fill time (HSCC) with 92% tool underutilization (Black Book) to support the interpretation that staffing constraints drive adoption failure. Hedged with "indicates" |
| 13 | Applied research register throughout thesis.md | Per vf-write governance: third-person analytical voice, data-first sentences, hedging on all interpretive statements, no first-person, no promotional headings |
| 14 | Removed prohibited words from previous version | Replaced "existential" (outside quotes), "crisis" (used "challenge" or specific terms), "devastating" (used "severe"), "massive" (used "significant" or "large"). Retained "desperate" and "catastrophic" only within direct quotes with citations |
| 15 | Treated $1.5B annual cost as derived estimate with qualification | The figure is built from assumptions in 04-cost.md, not a single primary source. Described as "estimated" and attributed to the analysis rather than a named organization |
