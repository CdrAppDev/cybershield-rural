## Evidence Excluded

| # | Evidence | Source | Reason for Exclusion |
|---|----------|--------|---------------------|
| 1 | 35-40% of breached small practices close permanently within two years | Critical Insight (unverified) | Flagged as "Unverified — requires confirmation" in research; not used in thesis |
| 2 | 53% reported increased mortality (Cynerio/Ponemon 2022) | Ponemon/Cynerio 2022 | Older data superseded by 2024-2025 Ponemon data (28-29%); also vendor-sponsored |
| 3 | Google parallel initiative details | Google, June 2024 | No enrollment numbers published; insufficient documentation to include |
| 4 | Specific CrowdStrike/Palo Alto product features | Vendor pages | Features not relevant; only pricing and minimum requirements matter for gap analysis |
| 5 | Detailed HITECH penalty tier amounts | Federal Register | Used summary; full tier breakdown in regulatory research file for reference only |
| 6 | Nordic Consulting details | Vendor page | Not an MSSP; IT consulting with Fortified partnership — not directly relevant |
| 7 | Ransom payment decline data (2025) | Sophos 2025 | Research flagged as possibly reflecting methodology changes; used with caution note only in prevalence context |
| 8 | $7.42M 2025 breach cost | IBM/Ponemon 2025 | Included in key statistics table but led with $9.77M (2024) as primary figure since 2025 decline may reflect temporary factors |

**Total evidence items excluded:** 8

## Customer Voice Decisions

| # | Quote | Source | Included | Theme Assigned | Rationale |
|---|-------|--------|----------|----------------|-----------|

| 28 | "Addressing top cybersecurity risks would have taken at least 18-24 months..." | Greenwood Leflore Hospital | No | N/A | Capacity constraint is already well-covered; this adds length not insight |

**Total quotes found:** 28
**Total quotes included:** 25
**Total themes identified:** 5
**Theme grouping rationale:** Grouped by the primary concern expressed: (1) Budget constraints as root cause, (2) Staffing as the operational manifestation, (3) Existential threat as the consequence, (4) Patient safety as the unique differentiator from other sectors, (5) Awareness evolution as context for market timing. Themes ordered from structural cause → operational reality → consequence → differentiator → context.

## Conflicts Found

| # | Topic | Value A | Source A | Value B | Source B | Resolution |
|---|-------|---------|----------|---------|----------|------------|
| 1 | Healthcare breach cost 2024 | $9.77M | IBM/Ponemon 2024 | $10.93M | IBM/Ponemon 2023 (peak) | Both presented; led with 2024 ($9.77M) as most current; noted decline from peak |
| 2 | Healthcare breach cost 2025 | $7.42M | IBM/Ponemon 2025 | $9.77M | IBM/Ponemon 2024 | Both in key statistics table; noted $2.35M decline but used 2024 as primary for conservative investor-facing materials |
| 3 | Rural hospital count | 1,796 | KFF | ~1,844 | Chartis | Both presented with methodology note; used "~1,800" as working figure |
| 4 | SC Critical Access Hospitals | 3 | Rural Health Information Hub | 4 | SC Office of Rural Health | Presented as "3-4" with discrepancy noted; recommend verification |
| 5 | Mortality increase from attacks | 28-29% (survey) | Ponemon/Proofpoint 2024-2025 | 53% (survey) | Cynerio/Ponemon 2022 | Used 28-29% as more recent and conservative; excluded 53% as older and vendor-sponsored |
| 6 | Ransomware payment trends | $1.5M median (2024) | Sophos 2024 | $150K median (2025) | Sophos 2025 | Both presented with caution note; 90% decline may reflect methodology or market shift |
| 7 | Microsoft program enrollment | 550+ | Microsoft Report, March 2025 | 700+ | AHA interview, July 2025 | Used 700+ (more recent); noted 550+ was earlier count |
| 8 | Average downtime | 18.71 days (2023 peak) | Comparitech/Statista | 17 days (2018-2024 avg) | Comparitech | Both presented; used "17-18.7 days" range |

## Gaps Identified

| # | Gap | Category | Impact |
|---|-----|----------|--------|
| 1 | No per-CAH or per-bed compliance cost for proposed HIPAA update | Cost of status quo | Cannot size exact compliance burden for a specific rural hospital |
| 2 | Rural hospital HIPAA compliance rates not available separately from general healthcare | Regulatory | Cannot compare rural vs urban compliance rates |
| 3 | Google rural hospital program enrollment unknown | Current solutions | Cannot compare to Microsoft program scale |
| 4 | MSSP pricing for rural hospitals not published | Current solutions | Cannot confirm whether MSSPs are affordable for negative-margin facilities |
| 5 | Rural-specific breach cost data limited to single AHA/Microsoft estimate ($11M) | Severity | IBM/Ponemon does not segment by hospital size; ~$11M is from one source |

**Total gaps identified:** 5

## Decisions Made

| # | Decision | Rationale |
|---|----------|-----------|
| 1 | Led with $9.77M (2024) over $7.42M (2025) for breach cost | 2025 decline may reflect temporary factors; $9.77M is more conservative for investor materials; both included in table |
| 2 | Used "~1,800" as working rural hospital count | Splits difference between KFF (1,796) and Chartis (~1,844); both cited with methodology |
| 3 | Grouped quotes into 5 themes (not 3 or 7) | 3 themes would merge distinct concerns (budget vs staffing); 7 would create themes with only 1-2 quotes; 5 provides clear structure with 4+ quotes each |
| 4 | Included 2025 Sophos improvement data with caution | Research flagged possible methodology changes; important to note not all trends are worsening; thesis notes "worsening overall" with nuance |
| 5 | Used Black Book Research as primary survey source | Most recent (June 2025), segment-specific (187 leaders at <150 bed hospitals), comprehensive coverage of all key metrics |
| 6 | Structured evidence.yaml with 8 prevalence + 8 severity stats | Exceeds 3+3 minimums significantly; research quality justified higher count rather than artificial trimming |
| 7 | Ordered thesis sections: problem → who → severity → current state → voice → cost → regulatory → alignment | Follows template but added regulatory section between cost and alignment since regulatory tailwind connects financial burden to capital opportunity |
| 8 | Excluded vendor feature details from thesis | Thesis purpose is problem validation, not competitive analysis — solution details will come in Phase 05 |
| 9 | Used customer voice theme "Awareness Without Capability" instead of "Threat Awareness" | The insight isn't just that they're aware — it's that awareness without resources is the defining tension |
| 10 | Included Change Healthcare as case study rather than standalone section | The breach is evidence of systemic vulnerability, not a separate topic; woven into cost, customer voice, and severity sections |
