# CyberShield Rural

**Managed Cybersecurity for Critical Access Hospitals**

## Overview

CyberShield Rural is a managed security service (not just software) for hospitals with <100 beds. The product is implementation + ongoing management—not another tool that sits unused.

## The Problem

- Healthcare ransomware attacks up 278% (2018-2023)
- Average breach costs $7.42M—most rural hospitals can't survive one
- Rural hospitals have 0-1 IT staff, no dedicated security expertise
- Enterprise security solutions cost $50K+ and require teams to operate
- Free government programs exist but require implementation knowledge hospitals don't have

## Key Insight

Microsoft offers 75% discounts on security tools, but only ~20% of rural hospitals adopt them. The gap isn't tools—it's expertise to implement and manage them. CyberShield fills that gap.
