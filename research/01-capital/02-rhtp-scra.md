# South Carolina healthcare cybersecurity startup funding: A strategic landscape

Two state-level funders and multiple federal programs offer viable paths for a healthcare cybersecurity startup in South Carolina, though each requires different positioning strategies. **The most actionable opportunity is SCRA's funding ecosystem**, which recently invested $250,000 in a cybersecurity startup and launched a Center for Cybersecurity in December 2025. The **Rural Health Transformation Program** presents a significant but indirect opportunity—South Carolina received **$200 million in FY2026**, with explicit eligibility for "cybersecurity capability development," but the state has not yet published its subaward application process. A critical constraint: federal SBIR/STTR programs expired in September 2025 and remain suspended, eliminating what was historically the primary federal path for cybersecurity startups.

## The Rural Health Transformation Program offers $200M through South Carolina

The federal program branded "Rural Health Transformation" (commonly abbreviated RHT, though sometimes called RHTP) represents a **$50 billion, five-year initiative** flowing from CMS to states, which then distribute funds to providers and eligible organizations. South Carolina's Department of Health and Human Services received **$200,030,252** for FY2026, announced December 29, 2025.

**Program structure is grant-based cooperative agreements** with no repayment requirement and no state matching funds needed. States cannot award funds directly to hospitals, universities, or startups—instead, SCDHHS will establish a subaward and subcontract process for eligible recipients.

The most relevant funding categories for healthcare cybersecurity include:

- **Category F (IT Advances)**: Explicitly funds "technical assistance, software, and hardware for significant information technology advances designed to improve efficiency, **enhance cybersecurity capability development**, and improve patient health outcomes"
- **Category D (Training/Technical Assistance)**: Supports "development and adoption of technology-enabled solutions that improve care delivery in rural hospitals, including remote monitoring, robotics, artificial intelligence"
- **Tech Catalyst Fund**: South Carolina's state-specific initiative providing "seed funding for innovative, startup health companies"—capped at **$20 million per year** (10% of state allocation or $20M, whichever is less)

**Critical gap: State-level application criteria have not been published.** SCDHHS has stated that "additional guidance on how stakeholders can learn more about RHT Program funding opportunities" will be announced via Medicaid bulletins. Direct inquiry is essential—contact grants@scdhhs.gov. The program explicitly requires a sustainability plan demonstrating viability beyond the five-year funding period.

Director Eunice Medina, confirmed February 2025, has emphasized that awards are for "one-time, high-impact investments" and warned: "Whatever you put in that application, that is your commitment. And if you don't do it, they'll give you the money upfront and take it right back."

## SCRA provides an established startup investment pipeline with cybersecurity priority

South Carolina Research Authority operates the state's primary innovation funding ecosystem through tiered grant programs and SC Launch Inc. equity investments. **SCRA's February 2025 investment in ThreatCaptain**, a Greenville cybersecurity company, demonstrates active appetite for the sector.

### SCRA grant programs and amounts

| Program | Amount | Purpose | Key requirement |
|---------|--------|---------|-----------------|
| **Startup Grant** | Up to $25,000 | Critical early milestones | SCRA Member Company |
| **Academic Startup Grant** | Up to $25,000 | Commercializing university IP | Institution partnership |
| **Acceleration Grant** | Up to $50,000 | Market readiness acceleration | Demonstrated traction |
| **Federal Matching Grant** | Up to $50,000 | 50% match for SBIR/STTR awards | Federal award recipient |
| **Demonstration Grant** | Varies | De-risking technology trials | Corporate partner |
| **Relocation Grant** | Up to $50,000 | Companies moving to SC | 5+ employees post-move |

**SC Launch Inc.** provides convertible loans and equity investments for Pre-Seed through Series B stages. The fund manages **$15 million** and recent investments range from **$200,000-$300,000** per round. Portfolio companies have generated **over $2.9 billion in follow-on funding** since 2006, with $303 million in FY2024 alone.

### Application process is invitation-only

Grants are not open for public application. Companies must first be accepted as **SCRA Member Companies** (acceptance rate below 40%), then receive invitation to apply from an assigned investment manager. Membership requires:

- Headquarters in SC **or** 51%+ of full-time employees in SC
- Operating in IT, Life Sciences, Advanced Manufacturing/Materials, or Clean Tech
- A working product beyond proof-of-concept stage
- Early market traction (pilots, users, trials)
- Scalable business model with competitive advantage (ideally IP protection)

Regional Investment Managers serve as primary contacts: Kevin Eichelberger (Charleston), Mitch Smith (Columbia), and Rob Moser (Greenville, Senior).

### Investment criteria favor healthcare cybersecurity positioning

SC Launch Inc. evaluates companies on ten characteristics including large/expanding markets, durable IP protection, experienced teams with advisory boards, and "high potential to attract follow-on funding." Due diligence covers competitive analysis, technology development plans, regulatory considerations, and IP review.

**The SC Launch Inc. board has healthcare expertise.** Chair Andrea Marshall serves as VP/General Counsel at MedTrust Holdings and founded the Innovation Director role at Roper St. Francis Research and Innovation Center. Board member Jon-Michial Carter founded ChartSpan Medical Technologies.

### Center for Cybersecurity signals state priority

Governor McMaster announced the **Center for Cybersecurity at SCRA** in December 2025—a new statewide hub implementing South Carolina's first cybersecurity strategic plan. Led by Brian Shea (20-year federal/state cyber planning veteran), the Center's objectives include "support[ing] SC cyber companies and position[ing] SC as a leader." This creates institutional alignment for healthcare cybersecurity ventures, though dedicated funding programs through the Center have not been announced.

## Track records reveal health IT investment patterns

### SCRA digital health portfolio companies (partial list)

| Company | Focus | Investment/Grant |
|---------|-------|------------------|
| **ThreatCaptain** | Financial cyber risk for MSPs | $250K equity + $50K grant |
| PulManage | Remote monitoring for lung disease | $250K investment |
| Qatalyst Health | Skilled nursing facility software | $50K acceleration grant |
| GreenCape Health (RheumApp) | Rheumatology patient outcomes | $75K in grants |
| Heartbeat Technologies | Cardiac arrest device | SC Launch portfolio |
| VirtueScript | Post-acute medication delivery | $250K investment |
| Clear Water Care Coordination | Discharge planning platform | $25K grant |

**No healthcare cybersecurity investment exists in the portfolio**—ThreatCaptain focuses on financial services. However, the combination of health IT companies and the ThreatCaptain cybersecurity investment suggests appetite for the intersection.

### Rural Health Transformation has no track record

The program is entirely new. First awards were announced December 29, 2025. No projects have been funded, and South Carolina has not yet issued subawards. The SC Center for Rural and Primary Healthcare operates a separate "Rural Innovations Cooperative Agreement Program" that has funded **20 projects totaling $2.4 million** since 2018, but no cybersecurity-specific projects appear in publicly available information.

## Federal programs present limited but specific opportunities

### ARPA-H UPGRADE is the most direct federal path

The Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health launched **UPGRADE** (Universal PatchinG and Remediation for Autonomous DEfense) with **$50 million** in funding. Unlike most federal programs, **private companies can apply directly**.

Technical focus areas include autonomous cyber-threat solutions for hospitals, vulnerability mitigation platforms, high-fidelity digital twins of hospital equipment, and automated defense development. Northeastern University's Archimedes Center received **$19 million** for the PATCH Project developing digital twins for medical device cybersecurity.

**Important caution**: Politico reported in August 2025 that the Trump administration cut ARPA-H funding for AI, preventive care, and cybersecurity programs exceeding $150 million. Current solicitation status requires direct verification with ARPA-H.

### SBIR/STTR programs remain suspended

The Small Business Innovation Research and Small Business Technology Transfer programs **expired September 30, 2025** and have not been reauthorized. No new solicitations can be released and no new awards can be issued. Multiple reauthorization bills are pending (S.1573/H.R.3169, INNOVATE Act), but no timeline is confirmed. When operational, HHS SBIR offered **Phase I awards up to $314,363** and **Phase II up to $2,095,748**.

SCRA's Federal Matching Grant ($50K matching 50% of federal awards) becomes valuable if SBIR programs are reauthorized.

### CISA programs exclude private companies

The State and Local Cybersecurity Grant Program (**$91.75 million** in FY2025) flows only to government entities. South Carolina's State Administrative Agency is SLED, with SC Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity coordinating. A startup could potentially contract with state/local governments receiving these funds, but no vendor procurement criteria are publicly available.

### HHS Office for Civil Rights has no funding programs

OCR functions as an enforcement agency for HIPAA rules—not a grantor. No grant programs exist for HIPAA compliance or cybersecurity solutions providers. The office provides technical assistance and educational resources only.

## Decision-makers and evaluation structures differ significantly

### SCRA evaluation is relationship-based

No public scoring rubrics exist. Investment decisions flow through assigned Investment Managers to the SC Launch Inc. board. The 23-member SCRA Board of Trustees includes university presidents (Clemson, MUSC, SC State, USC), state officials, and industry leaders. Governor McMaster or designee serves as Chairman.

**Explicit criteria not published**: Beyond the ten general investment characteristics, detailed scoring methodologies are not publicly available.

### Rural Health Transformation uses federal scoring at state level

The federal NOFO provides detailed rubrics: **50% weight** on rural facility/population data (uncompensated care, rural population percentage, frontier metrics) and **50% technical score** evaluating initiative quality. Each factor scores 0-20 points across strategy clarity, workplan detail, outcome measurability, impact significance, and sustainability.

**State-level subaward criteria are not yet published.** SCDHHS is required to make "process and criteria for selecting subawardees clear to CMS" but has not released these publicly. This represents a critical information gap for application planning.

## Strategic recommendations by funder

### For SCRA (highest immediate potential)

1. Apply for SCRA Membership first—this is prerequisite to all grant opportunities
2. Position at intersection of Life Sciences and Cybersecurity to align with two stated priority sectors
3. Build relationship with appropriate Regional Investment Manager
4. Emphasize MUSC partnerships if applicable—MUSC President serves on SCRA Board
5. Reference Center for Cybersecurity launch to demonstrate state strategic alignment
6. If pursuing federal SBIR/STTR (when reauthorized), the Federal Matching Grant doubles impact

### For Rural Health Transformation (longer-term opportunity)

1. Subscribe to SCDHHS Medicaid Bulletins immediately for application announcements
2. Contact grants@scdhhs.gov to express interest in Tech Catalyst Fund
3. Frame services under Category F language: "cybersecurity capability development" for rural providers
4. Develop partnerships with rural hospitals or Critical Access Hospitals as implementation partners
5. Prepare sustainability narrative—explicit requirement for demonstrating post-grant viability
6. Ensure service area includes HRSA-defined rural geographies

### For ARPA-H (R&D capability required)

1. Verify current solicitation status given reported August 2025 funding cuts
2. UPGRADE program requires strong technical capabilities in autonomous patching, digital twins, or vulnerability detection
3. Partnership with academic medical centers strengthens proposals (see Northeastern/Michigan Medicine model)

## Conclusion

South Carolina's funding landscape for healthcare cybersecurity has improved substantially with SCRA's December 2025 Center for Cybersecurity launch and the state's $200 million Rural Health Transformation allocation. However, **timing varies significantly by path**: SCRA membership can be pursued immediately with grant invitations following relationship development; RHT subaward applications await state process announcements; SBIR/STTR requires Congressional reauthorization.

The most actionable strategy is **dual-track engagement**: begin SCRA membership application while monitoring SCDHHS bulletins for RHT criteria. ThreatCaptain's $250,000 SCRA investment in February 2025 establishes precedent for cybersecurity funding, and the explicit Category F language in Rural Health Transformation creates federal-level validation for cybersecurity services to rural healthcare providers. The key constraint is that neither funder has published detailed evaluation criteria for cybersecurity-specific applications—relationship-building and direct inquiry remain essential.
