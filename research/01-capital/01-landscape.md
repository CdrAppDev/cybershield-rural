# Funding landscape for healthcare cybersecurity ventures serving rural hospitals

**The convergence of record federal investment and heightened investor interest creates unprecedented funding opportunities for healthcare cybersecurity startups targeting rural and critical access hospitals.** The CMS Rural Health Transformation Program now distributes **$10 billion annually** to all 50 states through 2030, with cybersecurity capability development explicitly listed as an approved use. Meanwhile, the healthcare cybersecurity market is projected to grow from $19.3 billion (2024) to $75 billion by 2032, driving significant VC attention. However, SBIR/STTR programs remain paused pending Congressional reauthorization—a critical gap affecting federal non-dilutive funding pathways.

## Conclusion: Strategic priorities for funder outreach

The funding landscape reveals three strategic imperatives for healthcare cybersecurity ventures targeting rural hospitals:

**Engage state agencies immediately for RHT Program funds.** With $10 billion distributed annually and explicit cybersecurity language, the Rural Health Transformation Program represents the largest near-term opportunity. Contact state Offices of Rural Health and health IT agencies to position as subrecipient technology partners before states deploy their FY2026 allocations.

**Build dual positioning for healthcare and cybersecurity investors.** The market gap for dedicated healthcare-cybersecurity investors means companies must credibly address both sectors. Lead outreach to healthcare-focused VCs with security differentiation (Flare Capital, 7wireVentures, Rock Health) and cybersecurity VCs with healthcare validation (Ballistic Ventures, Ten Eleven, ForgePoint). Town Hall Ventures and CommonSpirit Ventures offer highest alignment with underserved/rural market positioning.

**Monitor SBIR/STTR reauthorization closely.** When Congress reauthorizes the programs, HHS and DHS SBIR pathways will reopen as the primary non-dilutive funding mechanism for early-stage R&D. Prepare applications in advance using 3Phase (SC) or LaunchTN support services to maximize success probability.

**Key near-term deadlines:**
- AscendRural application: January 9, 2026
- AWS/CrowdStrike Accelerator: Program begins January 5, 2026
- MassChallenge Security & Resiliency: September 2025 start
- USDA DLT Grants: Annual competitive cycle (typically spring)
