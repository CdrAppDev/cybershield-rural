# Healthcare cybersecurity funding: federal and state requirements

Federal grants and state investment programs for healthcare cybersecurity have distinct eligibility pathways, with **critical program changes in 2025-2026** reshaping the funding landscape. NIH SBIR/STTR authority expired in October 2025, while CMS launched a **$50 billion Rural Health Transformation program** that explicitly includes cybersecurity as an allowable use. Private healthcare organizations cannot access CISA grants directly but can receive free technical services, while SCRA offers the most direct investment pathway for companies establishing South Carolina operations.

The key insight for application readiness: most federal programs do not directly fund private healthcare cybersecurity companies—they fund states, research institutions, or small businesses meeting specific criteria. Understanding which entity type you represent determines your viable funding pathways.

## Common eligibility criteria vary dramatically by program type

The fundamental distinction across these programs is **who can apply**, not what they're building. SBIR/STTR targets for-profit small businesses, CMS's Rural Health Transformation funds only states, CISA grants reach state/local governments exclusively, and SCRA invests in companies with South Carolina operations.

### Team requirements differ by program philosophy

**SBIR/STTR** (when reauthorized) requires a Principal Investigator "primarily employed" by the small business during the award period who demonstrates credibility through "education, work, and project management experience." STTR allows the PI to be employed by either the company or partner research institution. No specific healthcare or cybersecurity credentials are mandated in base eligibility—these are evaluated competitively.

### Stage and traction requirements create clear filters

| Program | Stage Requirement | Traction Evidence |
|---------|------------------|-------------------|
| SBIR Phase I | Proof of concept stage | Preliminary data helpful, not required |
| SBIR Phase II | Feasibility demonstrated | Phase I completion, customer interest |
| SCRA Membership | MVP required—"proof of concept" or "idea" stage rejected | Prior investment from principals/family expected |
| SCRA Investment | Accelerating or scaling stage | Validated business model required |
| CMS RHT | State government applicants only | N/A—all 50 states received awards |

SCRA explicitly states that companies with "just a proof of concept" are **too early** for membership consideration. The organization reports that **less than 40% of membership applications are accepted**.

### Technical and IP requirements across funders

**SBIR/STTR** grants the small business full ownership and title to data developed under the award, with protection from disclosure for **20 years minimum**. For STTR, both the small business and research institution must sign an IP agreement specifying rights sharing **before** the award.

## Critical program updates reshape available pathways

### NIH SBIR/STTR expired October 2025

The legislative authority for NIH SBIR/STTR programs **expired on October 1, 2025**. All NIH SBIR and STTR Notices of Funding Opportunity are currently expired. Active awards can continue, but NIH will not issue noncompeting continuation awards until reauthorized.

**Implication:** Healthcare cybersecurity ventures must pursue DHS SBIR, DoD SBIR/STTR (if applicable), or alternative federal funding until NIH programs are reauthorized.

- Relevance: Primary authoritative source for NIH program status

### "RHTP" is actually CMS Rural Health Transformation ($50B program)

**Important clarification:** There is no specific federal program officially called "Rural Health Technology Program (RHTP)" administered by HRSA. The relevant program is the **CMS Rural Health Transformation (RHT) Program**—a $50 billion program created by the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (Section 71401 of Public Law 119-21).

**Cybersecurity is explicitly allowable:** RHT funds can be used for "providing technical assistance, software, and hardware for significant information technology advances designed to improve efficiency, **enhance cybersecurity capability development**, and improve patient health outcomes."

**Eligibility limitation:** Only the 50 U.S. states can apply directly. Private companies may participate as subcontractors/partners after states receive funding.

### CISA does not fund private healthcare organizations directly

**Critical finding:** CISA's primary grant program (State and Local Cybersecurity Grant Program) is exclusively for state/local/tribal/territorial governments. Private healthcare organizations **cannot apply directly**.

**However, CISA offers free services to all critical infrastructure entities:**
- Vulnerability Scanning (continuous monitoring with weekly reports)
- Web Application Scanning (OWASP Top Ten vulnerabilities)
- Phishing Campaign Assessments
- Remote Penetration Testing

Organizations typically **reduce risk and exposure by 40% within 12 months** of enrollment, with most seeing improvements within 90 days.

**How to enroll:** Email vulnerability@cisa.dhs.gov with subject line "Requesting Cyber Hygiene Services"

### SCRA establishes Center for Cybersecurity (December 2025)

SCRA announced a **new statewide Center for Cybersecurity** in December 2025, housed at SCRA headquarters and led by Brian Shea, a 20-year veteran of federal/state cyber initiatives. The Center implements South Carolina's first statewide cybersecurity strategic plan with 20 discrete initiatives, including supporting cybersecurity companies and positioning SC as a cyber hub.

This creates new opportunities for healthcare cybersecurity ventures seeking South Carolina operations.

## Conclusion: Strategic readiness assessment

The healthcare cybersecurity funding landscape requires matching organizational type to appropriate programs. **For-profit companies** should prioritize DHS SBIR (while awaiting NIH reauthorization) and SCRA investment for those establishing South Carolina operations. **State agencies and public entities** have the broadest options through CMS RHT subcontracts and CISA SLCGP subawards. **All healthcare organizations** should immediately enroll in CISA's free cyber hygiene services regardless of other funding pursuits.

The most significant readiness gaps for most applicants are:
- **SBIR:** SAM.gov and SBIR.gov Company Registry registrations not current, PI employment structure not compliant
- **SCRA:** No South Carolina nexus, pre-MVP stage, no advisory board established
- **State program partnerships:** No relationships with State Administrative Agencies or State Offices of Rural Health

Pending legislation—including the Rural Hospital Cybersecurity Enhancement Act (S. 2169) and the Health Care Cybersecurity and Resiliency Act—may create direct federal grant pathways to private healthcare organizations, but these are not yet enacted and should not be relied upon for current planning.
