## Prompts

### Prompt 1: Funding Landscape

I am building a capital thesis for an early-stage healthcare cybersecurity venture targeting rural and critical access hospitals. This research will identify the full landscape of potential funders so we can prioritize outreach and align our positioning to what funders actually want.

Research the funding landscape for early-stage healthcare cybersecurity ventures, with emphasis on solutions serving rural hospitals.

First, identify all active funding sources in these categories:
- Government grants and federal programs (RHTP, CISA, HHS, USDA Rural Development, CMS)
- State-level economic development programs (South Carolina focus, but note other states with relevant programs)
- Venture capital firms with a healthcare cybersecurity or health IT thesis
- Strategic investors (hospital systems, health IT companies, cybersecurity firms investing in healthcare)
- Accelerators and incubators focused on healthcare, cybersecurity, or rural health

Then, for each funding source, provide:
- Organization name and program name
- Stated investment thesis or funding criteria
- Funding amounts and stages they target
- Recent investments or grants made (last 2 years)
- Application process overview (if public)

Scope:
- Focus on programs active as of 2026
- Include South Carolina state programs and national programs
- Early-stage focus (pre-seed through Series A, grants under $1M)
- Include programs specifically targeting rural healthcare or health IT security

If a funding source appears relevant but you cannot find detailed criteria, list it with a note that further research is needed. Do not speculate about criteria that aren't publicly documented.

For every claim, provide a citation in this format:
- **Source:** [Publication or organization name]
- **Date:** [Publication date or "Accessed YYYY-MM"]
- **URL:** [Direct link to the source]
- **Relevance:** [One sentence on why this source matters]

If a data point cannot be verified with a credible source, state "Unverified - requires confirmation" rather than omitting it or presenting it as fact.

Example of a well-documented funding source entry:
---
**SBIR Phase I (HHS)**
- **Thesis:** Fund early-stage R&D in health technology with commercial potential
- **Amount:** $150K-$275K per award
- **Stage:** Pre-revenue, proof of concept
- **Recent awards:** 47 cybersecurity-related awards in FY2024 (Source: SBIR.gov, Accessed 2025-01)
- **Process:** Annual solicitation, 6-month review cycle

### Prompt 2: RHTP and SCRA Deep Dive

I am evaluating the Rural Health Technology Program (RHTP) and the SC Research Authority (SCRA) as primary funding targets for a healthcare cybersecurity startup based in South Carolina. This deep dive will inform our application strategy and help us tailor materials to each funder's specific priorities.

For each funder listed below, research in this order:

1. First, establish the program structure:
   - How the program works (grant vs. equity vs. loan)
   - Eligibility requirements and restrictions
   - Funding amounts available
   - Application cycles and deadlines

2. Then, analyze their decision-making:
   - Stated evaluation criteria and scoring rubrics (if public)
   - Key decision makers and their backgrounds
   - Public statements about priorities or thesis
   - Board composition or investment committee

3. Finally, examine their track record:
   - Portfolio companies or past grantees (last 3 years)
   - Any funded projects in healthcare cybersecurity, health IT, or rural health technology
   - Success stories they highlight publicly
   - Reported outcomes or ROI of funded projects

Funders to research:

**RHTP (Rural Health Technology Program):**
- Federal program structure and how funds flow to states
- South Carolina's $200M allocation and "Tech Catalyst Fund" details
- Category F (IT Assistance) — criteria and eligible activities for cybersecurity
- Category D (Training/Tech Adoption) — criteria for security training components
- State-level administration and decision-making structure in SC

**SCRA (SC Research Authority):**
- Current funding programs (startup grants, acceleration grants, equity investments)
- Digital health portfolio companies and investment history
- Application requirements and evaluation criteria
- Any public statements about healthcare cybersecurity as a priority area

**Additional (if found during RHTP/SCRA research):**
- CISA (Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency) programs for healthcare
- HHS Office for Civil Rights — funding or incentive programs tied to HIPAA compliance
- Any other federal programs specifically funding healthcare cybersecurity solutions

If a funder's application process or criteria are not publicly available, state this explicitly. Do not infer criteria from funded projects alone — note that as circumstantial evidence, not confirmed criteria.

For every claim, provide a citation in this format:
- **Source:** [Publication or organization name]
- **Date:** [Publication date or "Accessed YYYY-MM"]
- **URL:** [Direct link to the source]
- **Relevance:** [One sentence on why this source matters]

If a data point cannot be verified with a credible source, state "Unverified - requires confirmation" rather than omitting it or presenting it as fact.

### Prompt 3: Federal Healthcare Cybersecurity Funding Requirements

I need to understand what it takes to successfully apply for federal grants and state investment programs in healthcare cybersecurity. This will help us prepare application materials and assess our readiness before applying.

Research typical requirements in this order:

1. First, identify common criteria across funders:
   - Team requirements (experience in cybersecurity, healthcare IT, HIPAA compliance)
   - Stage and traction requirements (revenue, users, LOIs, pilot deployments)
   - Technical requirements (IP, working prototype, security certifications, HIPAA compliance)
   - Market requirements (TAM thresholds, customer validation evidence)

2. Then, document the application process:
   - Standard documentation required (business plan, financials, pitch deck)
   - Technical documentation (architecture, security review, compliance certifications)
   - Timeline from application to decision (typical ranges for RHTP, SCRA, SBIR/STTR)
   - Multi-stage processes (LOI → full application → interview → decision)

3. Finally, analyze success factors:
   - Success rates where publicly available
   - Common reasons for rejection (if documented)
   - Red flags that disqualify applicants
   - Competitive dynamics (number of applicants vs. awards)

Scope:
- Focus on healthcare cybersecurity-specific requirements, not generic startup advice
- Include federal grant requirements (RHTP, SBIR/STTR, CISA) and state investment requirements (SCRA)
- Note where requirements differ significantly between program types
- Include any requirements specific to rural health or critical access hospital focus

Where success rates or rejection reasons are not publicly documented, say so rather than estimating.

For every claim, provide a citation in this format:
- **Source:** [Publication or organization name]
- **Date:** [Publication date or "Accessed YYYY-MM"]
- **URL:** [Direct link to the source]
- **Relevance:** [One sentence on why this source matters]

If a data point cannot be verified with a credible source, state "Unverified - requires confirmation" rather than omitting it or presenting it as fact.
