# Authentic voices from rural hospital cybersecurity leaders

Rural hospital IT administrators and executives describe cybersecurity as an impossible choice between protecting patient data and keeping hospital doors open. Across **17 distinct voices** from congressional testimony, news interviews, industry publications, and professional reports (2023-2026), a consistent pattern emerges: small hospitals face the same threat landscape as major health systems with a fraction of the staff, forcing "constant triage" where cybersecurity competes with CT machines, nursing salaries, and basic operational survival.

The most urgent finding is the existential nature of these challenges. St. Margaret's Health in Illinois became the first U.S. hospital to publicly cite a cyberattack as a direct contributor to permanent closure. The Change Healthcare breach caused rural hospitals to lose millions in claims, with one 63-bed Washington hospital reporting **$3.5 million in delayed payments**. These aren't theoretical concerns—they're active financial crises threatening rural healthcare access.

## "We could have cybersecurity, or we can get that CT machine"

The budget constraint emerges as the dominant pain point, expressed with remarkable consistency across sources. Jim Roeder, VP of IT at Lakewood Health System in Minnesota (a 25-bed critical access hospital), articulated the core dilemma in a June 2025 interview:

> "We could have a couple million dollars for cybersecurity, or we can get that CT machine that we need to bring in more revenue and keep the doors open. And so that's the constant battle that we face from our budget, when we have to go to the board."

This isn't hyperbole. Microsoft's Rural Hospital Cybersecurity Landscape Report (2025) estimates rural hospitals need **$30,000-$40,000 each** to reach baseline cybersecurity standards—modest by enterprise standards, but prohibitive when **50% of rural hospitals are operating in the red**. Kate Pierce, former CIO/CISO at North Country Hospital in Vermont who testified before the Senate in March 2023, reinforced this reality:

> "Our rural hospitals are facing unprecedented budget constraints with up to 30% or more in the red."

Jennifer Stoll, Chief External Affairs Officer at OCHIN (a collaborative of safety net organizations), captured the systemic underfunding in a June 2025 interview:

> "We're the least funded section of the delivery system, and we are the most vulnerable when it comes to cybersecurity. Everybody needs a lot of money to be able to support the cybersecurity infrastructure, because we are really facing a national crisis, which is a war against our healthcare providers every day, with bad actors domestically, but mostly abroad. And we just don't have the resources."

**Emotional register:** Resignation mixed with urgency. These leaders aren't asking for sympathy—they're documenting impossible arithmetic.

## "Two to five people doing the work of 20"

Staffing constraints rival budget as the defining challenge. Jackie Mattingly, Senior Director of Consulting Services at Clearwater and a member of the HSCC resource-constrained provider task group, synthesized what she observes across rural hospital clients in a 2025 TechTarget feature:

> "The rural hospital leaders I work with know exactly what needs to be done, but they're running on shoestring budgets with two to five people doing the work of 20. Meanwhile, threat actors are growing more sophisticated, using AI to exploit gaps in staffing, training and aging systems. The current state of rural health is one of constant triage, and cybersecurity has become yet another critical area competing for already-stretched resources."

Jim Roeder described the daily reality at Lakewood Health:

> "At a critical access hospital, all of us probably do five different job roles in a given day. It's just the nature of the beast."

> "Everyone here is wearing multiple hats. We'd love to have someone who could be dedicated to reviewing logs and alerts, but we can't because we don't have the workforce."

John Riggi, National Adviser for Cybersecurity at the American Hospital Association, offered the most vivid illustration:

> "At a lot of these facilities, the IT director is looking at logs one minute, and the next minute, he's changing light bulbs."

Mattingly expanded on this pattern from her consulting work:

> "Oftentimes what I'm seeing is the director is not just the director of IT, but they are also working the help desk, being the network administrator, out there fixing printers on the floor, working the EHR—so they're wearing, you know, 15, 20 hats. They just don't have the bandwidth to keep up. They're putting out operational duties instead of trying to be proactive in things."

**Emotional register:** Dark humor masking exhaustion. The "changing light bulbs" image has become symbolic shorthand in the rural health IT community.

## The recruitment paradox in rural healthcare

Remote work, initially seen as a lifeline for rural hospital IT recruitment, created an unexpected problem. Jim Roeder explained in a 2025 interview:

> "It kind of hurt us, because these people with that knowledge all of a sudden can work for bigger companies elsewhere, too."

> "[It's difficult to] find people that have the knowledge that want to work in healthcare in a rural area."

Kate Pierce, drawing on her 21 years leading IT at North Country Hospital, described the compensation gap:

> "We can't compete with larger facilities, especially when it comes to salary and incentives, when we're located in a remote part of Vermont."

> "The difference between being a Johns Hopkins or a UNC versus being a small critical access hospital or even just a one- or two-provider practice is significant because you have the same requirements. You have to protect your network, you have to do all those things, but you have a fraction of the staff."

Bob Olson, President and CEO of the Montana Hospital Association, summarized the dual barrier in an August 2024 NPR interview:

> "For a couple of reasons: It is expensive, and to find the IT professionals, they have the same kinds of problems with recruiting people to be in the more rural communities."

An anonymous rural hospital CIO quoted in Microsoft's 2025 report proposed what they called a "farm team" program—a workforce development pipeline that would "not only support the hospital, but bring renewed opportunities to the local job market and economies of these rural communities."

## Change Healthcare breach devastated rural hospitals disproportionately

The February 2024 Change Healthcare ransomware attack, described as "the most significant cyberattack on the U.S. health sector in history," hit rural hospitals with particular severity. Their reliance on single clearinghouse vendors and lack of cash reserves made them acutely vulnerable.

Cathy Bambrick, representing Astria Toppenish Hospital (a 63-bed community hospital in Washington), described the impact as **"potentially catastrophic"** during an April 2024 Washington State Hospital Association briefing. Her hospital was down **$3.5 million in typical claims payments**.

Cassie Sauer, President and CEO of the Washington State Hospital Association, detailed the operational chaos:

> "A lot of hospitals … went ahead and provided services without prior authorizations. That is very, very nerve wracking, to provide care to someone who you know needs the care, insurance requires you to get it authorized, the system was not working. You could not get a prior authorization."

> "And so now we're really worried they're not going to get paid. And that is going to be a disaster, honestly."

> "We did see people who got sicker because they weren't getting their regular medications filled."

The American Medical Association surveyed physicians following the breach. Anonymous rural practitioners provided devastating testimony:

> "This cyberattack is leading me to bankruptcy, and I am just about out of cash."

> "This crippled our brand new practice. I am keeping the lights on using personal funds."

> "…may bankrupt our practice of 50 years in this rural community."

Mary Mayhew, President and CEO of the Florida Hospital Association, warned during the acute phase:

> "I've got a lot of small rural hospitals where this is going to be a significant financial change."

> "When you talk about private independent physician practices, small and midsize, some of them may not be able to weather the storm."

Blayne Osborn, President of Nevada Rural Hospital Partners, stated in support of cybersecurity legislation in July 2024:

> "The cyberattacks on Change Healthcare this year have caused a severe interruption to Nevada's Critical Access Hospitals."

**Emotional register:** Fear and desperation. The phrase "keeping the lights on using personal funds" captures the existential threat these attacks represent.

## "It's not if but when"—the evolved threat awareness

Rural hospitals have abandoned the once-common belief that they're too small to target. Steve Barnett, CEO of McKenzie Health System in Michigan, summarized this evolution after his hospital experienced a ransomware attack in 2022:

> "If you are operating in an electronic environment, as most healthcare providers are, it is not if you will suffer a cyberattack, it is when you will become a victim and so organizations should make sure they are educating, communicating, and preparing for disaster recovery. They [threat actors] are going to get in."

Kate Pierce documented this shift:

> "We're getting past where rural hospitals used to feel like, 'Oh, nobody's going to target us because we're rural.' They're starting to realize now that it doesn't matter where you are in the world, or whether you're rural or you're a large facility."

Jim Roeder framed the current reality:

> "What we're facing is what everyone is facing with ransomware attacks and bad actors. And then we have other problems because we're rural. I think we're seen as a potentially easy target."

> "People don't realize how much these smaller systems are attacked and get hit by ransomware or are extorted just as much as the larger systems."

Jennifer Stoll challenged the assumption that small hospitals have "less valuable" data:

> "Just because they're low resource communities doesn't mean that it's not great data to be able to hijack or steal. Even if you're dealing with low income and underserved or rural communities, you know, it still creates havoc, and it still allows them to have a very powerful weapon, with lots of things that they can do for nefarious purposes."

## When hospitals go down, patients have nowhere else to go

The patient safety dimension distinguishes rural hospital cybersecurity from other sectors. Kate Pierce made this point in congressional testimony and subsequent interviews:

> "The impact on rural communities during a cyberattack is hard to overstate. While attacks in urban areas are impactful, populated areas provide other healthcare options for patients to choose. In most rural areas, the next closest healthcare facility may be 45 miles away or more, making the diversion of patients infeasible."

> "We have to be able to offer care. There's not another facility for 40 miles—we can't just say, 'sorry, we can't take you. Our network is down.'"

Jim Roeder described the contingency planning nightmare:

> "We got to try and hope they have room for these patients. And you know, we have two ambulances. How do you get them there? How do you transport them there in a timely manner?"

Jennifer Stoll captured the impossible position:

> "If you have a gun to your head, because they've got all your data and they've frozen your system, you're down. And you are creating a real vulnerability in terms of patient care."

Kate Pierce connected cybersecurity directly to clinical outcomes:

> "Those small facilities try to keep going, but the impact of continuing to see patients still can cause significant delays in care. We're so dependent on medical records now for the information that we use to treat our patients, so if a physician doesn't have access to the medical record when he's seeing the patient, he can't make the best possible decisions in that case."

Microsoft's 2025 report quantified this: **20% of hospitals that experienced a cyberattack reported an increase in patient mortality**.

## St. Margaret's Health: the first hospital to close from a cyberattack

St. Margaret's Health in Spring Valley, Illinois, became the first U.S. hospital to publicly attribute its closure to a ransomware attack. Linda Burt, Vice President of Quality and Community Services, described the aftermath to NBC News in June 2023:

> "You're dead in the water. We were down a minimum of 14 weeks. And then you're trying to recover. Nothing went out. No claims. Nothing got entered. So it took months and months and months."

The 44-bed rural hospital used **60,000 sheets of paper** during the attack and spent months trying to recover billing. Some claims were never paid due to insurers' timely filing requirements.

Sister Suzanne Stahl, Chair of SMP Health (St. Margaret's parent organization), announced the closure in a Facebook video:

> "Due to a number of factors, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, the cyberattack on the computer system of St. Margaret's Health, and a shortage of staff, it has become impossible to sustain our ministry. This saddens us greatly."

> "Rural hospitals have been struggling throughout the nation, and many have already closed."

**Emotional register:** Grief and defeat. The phrase "dead in the water" recurred across multiple interviews about the closure.

## The "do nothing" rationale and competing priorities

Understanding why some hospitals haven't addressed cybersecurity reveals systemic, not individual, failures. Kate Pierce explained the post-COVID financial reality:

> "Coming out of COVID, those facilities are particularly strapped budget-wise, and so it becomes very difficult for them to justify spending money on cybersecurity versus nursing staff, et cetera. Cybersecurity is currently not mandated, therefore, it's a difficult decision to spend money in those areas."

Roger Neal, VP and COO of DRH Health in Oklahoma, described the complexity barrier:

> "The healthcare industry is so complex and there are so many systems inside our hospitals and our clinics that we depend on other people. It is very difficult as you get out into rural markets to really compete and be able to do those things."

> "There aren't enough security personnel, security staff in the country to do everything we need them to do."

An anonymous hospital IT professional captured the compliance-versus-security gap in an academic study published in PubMed Central:

> "Compliance is a low bar. I guarantee that little healthcare organizations and hospitals would do nothing [without regulation]. They would have a piece of paper on a shelf called their security policy. It's needed as a backstop to get companies at least thinking about it. But being compliant does not solve the greater risk management problem."

The Director of Information Systems at Greenwood Leflore Hospital in Mississippi, quoted in Microsoft's 2025 report, noted that addressing their top cybersecurity risks **"would have taken at least 18-24 months to start, given severe capacity constraints of their small hospital IT department."**

## Unmet needs expressed independently by multiple sources

Rural hospital IT leaders consistently request:

- **Federal funding tied to cybersecurity requirements** — Not mandates without resources, but supported implementation
- **Managed security services accessible to small budgets** — "Out-of-the-box" solutions that don't require dedicated security staff
- **Standardized playbooks for incident response** — "Today, each hospital develops their approach and policies independently"
- **Vendor accountability for medical device security** — "If they want these devices to be put into healthcare systems, they have to be willing to patch them, support them, make sure they stay secure"
- **Workforce development pipelines** — The "farm team" concept connecting IT training to rural employment
- **Cloud migration support** — To reduce on-premise security burden ("my IT manager has said he will never go back, because now he sleeps at night")

## What's working: partnerships and free resources

Despite the challenges, rural hospitals are finding workarounds. Jim Roeder described progress through Microsoft's rural hospital program:

> "It's a journey that we're on, but we're far better off than we were a year ago. There are a lot of different pieces that go into it, and all of it together is what allows us to be safe."

Lakewood Health elevated its Microsoft "secure score" from **19.5 to 47** in just months through the partnership. Implementation timelines dropped from **6-8 months to 10-12 weeks**.

Virgil Eyer, Network Administrator at Fulton County Medical Center (a 21-bed critical access hospital in Pennsylvania), emphasized the value of external expertise:

> "It's nice to have someone who has been there from the ground floor and can help out with any questions or concerns."

> "Our goal is to be proactive instead of reactive. It's all about making steady progress one step at a time."

Kate Pierce described her facility's cloud-first strategy:

> "We've gone with a cloud first strategy, and I can tell you that my IT manager has said he will never go back, because now he sleeps at night. When you think about the resources that these large EHR vendors have versus a small critical access hospital, we really can't provide the same service to maintain and secure those servers."

## Key statistics from industry reports

- **Only 65%** of rural hospitals have basic email security (Microsoft 2025)
- **Only 69%** have multi-factor authentication implemented
- **Only 33%** have vendor cybersecurity requirements
- **Only 29%** adequately separate end-user and privileged accounts
- **$1.9 million per day** average cost of downtime following ransomware
- **18.7 days** average downtime following attack
- **50% of rural hospitals** operating in the red (2024, up from 43% in 2023)
- **80% of physician practices** lost revenue during Change Healthcare breach
- **55%** of practices had to use personal funds during the breach

## Conclusion: a sector in "constant triage"

The authentic customer voice from rural hospital cybersecurity leaders reveals a sector caught between awareness and capability. These IT administrators know exactly what needs to be done—they list specific tools, processes, and resources with precision—but face systematic barriers to implementation. The recurring emotional register combines resignation with urgent advocacy: they've accepted the constraints but haven't stopped fighting for change.

The most actionable insight for product design is the explicit demand for **"out-of-the-box" managed solutions** that don't require dedicated security staff to operate. Rural hospital IT directors aren't looking for enterprise-grade flexibility—they're looking for prescriptive, maintained, and affordable protection that works within their "15-20 hats" reality.

For investor narrative, the market opportunity lies in the gap between rural hospitals' $30,000-$40,000 baseline security needs and current vendor pricing. As Jim Roeder noted, "People don't realize how much these smaller systems are attacked." The threat is real, the need is documented, and the current solutions remain inaccessible to the most vulnerable providers.
